title: Sparse mode analysis
from: markdown+emoji <!--# allows emojis #-->
---

Analyzing data generated with sparse mode is nearly identical to the dense mode analysis steps, with a few key differences:

1.  The machine learning model file must be provided

2.  The prediction step is performed before calculating synergy

## Gather files

Gather the required metadata file and raw file(s), we recommend putting them into separate folders for simplicity:

-   meta 📂

    -   Contains the single metadata .csv file

-   raw 📂

    -   Contains the raw file(s) in 384-well format (and nothing else)

Nothing else should be in these folders at the start of analysis.

## Deployable ensemble model

Combocat's ensemble machine learning model is packaged (serialized) and ready to be deployed. As new iterations of models are released, they will be available in the repository's [models](https://github.com/wcwr/combocat/tree/main/models) folder.

You can read the model file directly into R from the repository:

``` r
model_link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wcwr/combocat/main/models/m10_Jun_2024_05.00PM_Train552_Test184_TuneT.RDS"

my_model <- 
  readRDS(url(model_link))
```

Check to make sure this is the latest/desired model before loading

#### **Model nomenclature:**

The model is a single file and is named according to specific nomenclature which can tell us some useful information. For example, the model `m10_Jun_2024_05.00PM_Train552_Test184_TuneT.RDS`, can tell us the following:

![](images/ML_Model_Nomenclature.png){width="600"}

-   "m" : prepended to all models so files don't start with numbers

-   `<date>` the model was created

-   `<time>` the model was created

-   Train`<number>` : Number of samples that were used in the training set

-   Test`<number>`: Number of samples that were used in the test set

-   Tune`<T/F>`: Indicates if hyperparameter tuning of each model was used

The number of training/test set samples also indicates their proportion and the total sample size. 552 + 184 = 736 total samples, indicating a 75/25 split (the default in `cc_buildModel`)

### Quick start

The entire sparse mode analysis can be run in the following single block.

::: callout-caution
For larger datasets, these steps should be broken up to avoid running out of resources
:::

``` r

mappedData <- 
  cc_map(meta_sparse, getwd())   #Map data

normData <- 
  cc_norm(mappedData) %>%        #Normalize
  cc_predict(my_model, .) %>%    #Predict the 90 non-measured indices
  cc_getSyn(.)                   #Calculate synergy
  
drData <- 
  cc_getDR(normData)             #Fit dose-response curves

cc_report(normData,              #Generate report
          drData,
          cd_plots    = cc_plotMat(normData, "perc_cell_death", color_midpoint = 50),  
          syn_plots   = cc_plotMat(normData, "bliss_synergy",   color_midpoint = 20),
          extra_plots = cc_plotExtras(normData, color_midpoint=20))
```
