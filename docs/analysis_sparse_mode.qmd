## Deployable ensemble model

Combocat's ensemble machine learning model is packaged (serialized) and ready to be deployed. As new iterations of models are released, they will be available in the repository's [models](https://github.com/wcwr/combocat/tree/main/models) folder.

You can read the model file directly into R from the repository:

``` r
model_link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wcwr/combocat/main/models/m10_Jun_2024_05.00PM_Train552_Test184_TuneT.RDS"

my_model <- 
  readRDS(url(model_link))
```

::: callout-note
Check to make sure this is the latest/desired model before loading

#### **Model nomenclature:**

The model is a single file and is named according to specific nomenclature which can tell us some useful information. For example, the current model at time of writing is `m10_Jun_2024_05.00PM_Train552_Test184_TuneT.RDS`, which tells us:
