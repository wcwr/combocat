    "text": "Dose ‚Äúdensity‚Äù\nOne of the biggest limitations in drug combination studies is the lack of sufficient dose density ‚Äì the number of concentrations tested for each drug. Dense measurements across a broad range of concentrations are crucial for capturing complete drug response and synergy patterns. However, technical constraints in combination screening often lead to fewer doses tested, resulting in formats that may risk missing critical interaction details.\n\n\n\nSmall, sparse, or asymmetric combination matrix designs\n\n\nAdvancements in liquid dispensing technology, like acoustic dispensing, have revolutionized compound transfer by enabling more flexible and precise experimental designs. Acoustic liquid handlers can dispense nanoliter volumes from any well of a source plate to any well of a destination plate without physical contact, greatly enhancing throughput potential.\nWe take advantage of this flexibility and designed screening templates that allow dense measurements. Specifically, Combocat tests drugs in a 10 ‚®â 10 format. Additionally, in ‚Äúdense mode‚Äù (described below) there are 3 replicates of each matrix produced for each drug combination.\n\nIn this plate design, we fit three replicate 10 ‚®â 10 combination matrices, three 10-point dose-response curves for each single-agent, and 12 replicates of each control. Screening combinations in this dense format and with replicates captures much wider drug response and synergy landscapes.",

The scale of a combination experiment increases rapidly with each tested drug, and testing many combinations has traditionally been impractical.\nCombocat is a method for scalable drug combination screening which uses acoustic liquid handler protocols and custom drug template designs for fast, efficient screening. Everything has been designed to work in an end-to-end fashion. This means a researcher can test 1, hundreds, or even thousands of drug combinations from start to finish.\n\nCritically, Combocat also provides a complete framework for analyzing the experimental data. Analysis is straightforward and provides interpretable publication-quality figures.\nCombocat is fully open-source!üéâ",
