Then we’ll setup a copy for ourselves so that we can modify from a working example, which is a great way to learn something new. We’ll set it up so that any modifications (commits) will automatically be republished via GitHub Actions.

These instructions will take ~5 minutes.\nNow you’ve got a copy of your repo of choice in your own GitHub account, and you’re set to start making your own edits. Your GitHub repo is set up with a GitHub Action that will use Quarto to rebuild and republish your site anytime you make a commit: committing will trigger the GitHub Action to rebuild and republish the book.\nNote that the GitHub Action for this book does not include R or Python so those will need to be added if your website relies on code. See https://github.com/r-lib/actions for more details and examples.\n\nDownload instead of fork\nForking might not always be the way to go - you can’t fork into the same GitHub user account or organization so if for example you want to make a copy of 2021-Cloud-Hackathon repo within the same NASA-Openscapes GitHub Organization, you’ll need to download instead of fork. In this case, follow these steps to download and copy into a new repository, and set up the GitHub Action and the gh-pages branch for publishing, separately.\n\nDownload github repo files\nNavigate to https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial (or any other quarto site repo of choice). Click the green “Code” button and select “Download ZIP”. When it downloads on your computer, unzip the files.\n\n\nCreate a new GitHub repo\nNavigate to your GitHub account or organization, and create a new repository, naming it what you’d like. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username). When you’re logged in, github.com will show a green button that says “New” which you’ll also see as you navigate to your username’s repository page.\n\n\nAdd original site files\nIf you’re comfortable cloning the new repository and copying files into it locally before committing and pushing back to GitHub, that is preferable to the GitHub file uploader, which does have limitations with complex repos. The uploader does not allow upload of folders, so some manual work would be required.\nTo use the GitHub file uploader, click the button next to the green “Code” button that says “Add file”.

Your GitHub repo is set up with a GitHub Action that will use Quarto to rebuild and republish your site anytime you make a commit: committing will trigger the GitHub Action to rebuild and republish the book.\nNote that the GitHub Action for this book does not include R or Python so those will need to be added if your website relies on code. See https://github.com/r-lib/actions for more details and examples.\n\nDownload instead of fork\nForking might not always be the way to go - you can’t fork into the same GitHub user account or organization so if for example you want to make a copy of 2021-Cloud-Hackathon repo within the same NASA-Openscapes GitHub Organization, you’ll need to download instead of fork. In this case, follow these steps to download and copy into a new repository, and set up the GitHub Action and the gh-pages branch for publishing, separately.\n\nDownload github repo files\nNavigate to https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial (or any other quarto site repo of choice). Click the green “Code” button and select “Download ZIP”. When it downloads on your computer, unzip the files.\n\n\nCreate a new GitHub repo\nNavigate to your GitHub account or organization, and create a new repository, naming it what you’d like. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username). When you’re logged in, github.com will show a green button that says “New” which you’ll also see as you navigate to your username’s repository page.\n\n\nAdd original site files\nIf you’re comfortable cloning the new repository and copying files into it locally before committing and pushing back to GitHub, that is preferable to the GitHub file uploader, which does have limitations with complex repos. The uploader does not allow upload of folders, so some manual work would be required.\nTo use the GitHub file uploader, click the button next to the green “Code” button that says “Add file”.

Dense measurements across a broad range of concentrations are crucial for capturing complete drug response and synergy patterns. However, technical constraints in combination screening often lead to fewer doses tested, resulting in formats that may risk missing critical interaction details.\n\n\n\nSmall, sparse, or asymmetric combination matrix designs\n\n\nAdvancements in liquid dispensing technology, like acoustic dispensing, have revolutionized compound transfer by enabling more flexible and precise experimental designs. Acoustic liquid handlers can dispense nanoliter volumes from any well of a source plate to any well of a destination plate without physical contact, greatly enhancing throughput potential.\nWe take advantage of this flexibility and designed screening templates that allow dense measurements. Specifically, Combocat tests drugs in a 10 ⨉ 10 format. Additionally, in “dense mode” (described below) there are 3 replicates of each matrix produced for each drug combination.\n\nIn this plate design, we fit three replicate 10 ⨉ 10 combination matrices, three 10-point dose-response curves for each single-agent, and 12 replicates of each control. Screening combinations in this dense format and with replicates captures much wider drug response and synergy landscapes.",

The scale of a combination experiment increases rapidly with each tested drug, and testing many combinations has traditionally been impractical.\nCombocat is a method for scalable drug combination screening which uses acoustic liquid handler protocols and custom drug template designs for fast, efficient screening. Everything has been designed to work in an end-to-end fashion. This means a researcher can test 1, hundreds, or even thousands of drug combinations from start to finish.\n\nCritically, Combocat also provides a complete framework for analyzing the experimental data. Analysis is straightforward and provides interpretable publication-quality figures.",
