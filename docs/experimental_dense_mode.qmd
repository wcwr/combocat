title: Dense mode protocol

::: {.callout-tip}
## Adjust accordingly
This protocol details an example of **1 drug combination**. For more combinations, adjust according to your need.
:::

See the Overview section for materials required.

## 1: Determine drug concentrations

Choose the desired drugs and their corresponding concentrations. Each drug will have 10 doses. As mentioned above, this example will detail how to screen one combination (2 drugs), but this can be adjusted according to experimental needs.

**Start by choosing the maximum desired concentration of each drug**. Check out the template below which takes the top chosen max concentration and makes a serial dilution according to the specified dilution factor:

-   The dilution factor is set to 1:3 by default (our recommendation), but this may be modified to anything (e.g. 1:2.5).

-   Check out the stock plate map (below the concentration ranges) for details on how this plate will look.

-   **Stocks drugs must be soluble at 400X final desired concentrations.**

## 2: Prepare the stock plate

Make the stock plate in a 384-well polypropylene (pp) plate that is [Echo-compatible](https://www.mybeckman.co/supplies/echo-qualified-supplies/acoustic-liquid-handler-microplates/001-14555) according to the following template:

(Use the spreadsheet template from step 1 to see details of how the plate should look).

-   **All wells should contain 50 µL**, which is enough to make [9 assay-ready plates]{.underline}.

-   Drug 1 in the top row and Drug 2 in the bottom row

-   DMSO is plated in 4 wells to account for the 'back-filling' transfer steps

-   Staurosporine at a final concentration of (10 µM / 400 =) 25 µM is the cell death control

::: {.callout-warning}
Ensure Staurosporine is an effective cell death control for your cell line before proceeding.

## 3: Prepare the assay-ready plate

Use the stock plate to construct the **assay-ready plate**:

-   It's called "assay-ready" because these plates are ready for cells to be added.

-   Once plates are made, they can be stored at -80 °C until ready for cells.

-   The Echo requires an **.EPR file** to perform the transfer

-   This file contains information on the source/destination wells, and volume to transfer.

-   The Combocat dense mode EPR file looks like this:

Download the EPR file from the [combocat github](https://github.com/wcwr/combocat/blob/main/Dense_Mode_Echo_Transfer.epr) and use it to make assay-ready plate:

(NOTE that you can make 9 of the assay-ready plates).

## Protocol

Step 1: Determine the drugs and concentrations

Step 2: Make the stock plate

Step 3: Make the assay-ready plate

1.  Determine desired final concentrations of each drug

2.  Make the stock plate

3.  Make the assay-ready plate

4.  Plate cells

5.  Measure viability

6.  Collect raw data in 384-well format
