## Welcome {#welcome}

This is the documentation for Combocat, a start-to-finish platform for drug combination screening.

Combocat is fully open-source!:tada:

In this documentation, you will find steps to complete both **experimental** and **analytical** parts of Combocat experiments. The experimental sections include step-by-step protocols with examples. In the data analysis sections, we provide steps for processing and analyzing results using the `combocat` R package. Browse links in the sidebar to the left to find out information about each step.

:bulb: Tip: use the search function in the side bar to look for specific protocol steps or topics

## Overview

Drug combinations are critical to conditions like cancers and infectious diseases, but finding new combinations is a slow and challenging process. The scale of a combination experiment increases rapidly with each tested drug, and testing many combinations has traditionally been impractical.

**Combocat is a method for scalable drug combination screening** which uses acoustic liquid handler protocols and custom drug template designs for fast, efficient screening. Everything has been designed to work in an end-to-end fashion. This means a researcher can test 1, hundreds, or even thousands of drug combinations from start to finish.

Critically, Combocat also provides a complete framework for analyzing the experimental data. Analysis is straightforward and provides interpretable publication-quality figures.
