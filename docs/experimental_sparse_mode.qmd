title: Sparse mode protocol
---

::: callout-tip
## Adjust accordingly

This protocol details an example of **1 combination** (2 drugs). Sparse mode can be scaled to screen 135 drugs (9,045 combinations).
:::

See the [Overview](experimental_landing.qmd) section for materials required.

## 1: Determine drug concentrations

Choose the desired drugs and their corresponding concentrations. Each drug will have 10 doses. As mentioned above, this example will detail how to screen 1 combination (2 drugs), but this can be adjusted according to experimental needs.

**Start by choosing the maximum desired concentration of each drug**. Check out the template below which takes the top chosen max concentration and makes a serial dilution according to the specified dilution factor:

-   The dilution factor is set to 1:3 by default (our recommendation), but this may be modified to anything (e.g. 1:2.5).

-   Check out the stock plate map (below the concentration ranges) for details on how this plate will look.

-   **Stocks drugs must be soluble at 400X final desired concentrations.**

## 2: Prepare the stock plate

Make the stock plate in a 384-well polypropylene (pp) plate that is [Echo-compatible](https://www.mybeckman.co/supplies/echo-qualified-supplies/acoustic-liquid-handler-microplates/001-14555) according to the following template:

![](images/Dense_mode_stock_plate.svg){width="380"}

(Use the spreadsheet template from step 1 to see details of how the plate should look).

-   We recommend volumes of **50 ¬µL** to maximize the number of assay-ready plates that can be made. Stock plates can be frozen until ready to make assay-ready plates.

-   Drug 1 in the top row, and Drug 2 in the bottom row

-   DMSO is plated in 4 wells to account for the 'back-filling' transfer steps

-   Staurosporine at a final concentration of (10 ¬µM / 400 =) 25 ¬µM is the cell death control

::: callout-warning
Ensure Staurosporine is an effective cell death control for your cell line before proceeding.
:::

## 3: Prepare assay-ready plates

Use the stock plate to construct the **assay-ready plates**:

![](images/sparse_stock_to_assay_ready.svg){width="950"}

-   They're called "assay-ready" because these plates are ready for cells to be added.

    ::: callout-note
    Unlike dense mode, sparse mode has separate **single-agent** and **combination plates**.
    :::

-   Once plates are made, they can be stored at -80 ¬∞C until ready for cells.

-   The Echo requires an **.EPR file** to perform the transfer, so 2 are needed for sparse mode: one for single-agent (SA) plates and one for combination plates.

-   EPR files contain information on the source/destination wells, and volume to transfer.

-   The Combocat sparse mode EPR files for this example look like this:

### Single-agent plate protocol

### Combination plate protocol

</iframe>

Download the EPR file from the [combocat github](https://github.com/wcwr/combocat/blob/main/Dense_Mode_Echo_Transfer.epr) and use it to make assay-ready plate:

::: callout-tip
You can modify the spreadsheet and import it into the Echo software to make your own EPR file.
:::

This Echo protocol can be used up to 9 times to make [9 assay-ready plate copies]{.underline}.

## 4: Plate cells & incubate

-   Plate **40 ¬µL of cells** into all wells.

    -   This is much easier with a liquid handler like the [Multidrop Combi](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-equipment/microplate-instruments/multidrop-dispensers.html) or similar, but can be achieved using multi-channel pipettes as well.

-   Incubate cells for desired treatment time

::: callout-warning
We recommend 72-hour treatments. After 96-hours, evaporation of media begins to disrupt data quality.
:::

## 5: Measure viability

The following steps are specific to [CellTiter-Glo](https://www.promega.com/resources/protocols/technical-bulletins/0/celltiter-glo-luminescent-cell-viability-assay-protocol/)

-   Equilibrate plate(s) to room temperature

-   Add **25 ¬µL** prepared CTG reagent

    -   ::: callout-important
        While the manufacturer recommends a 1:1 ratio, Do NOT dispense more than 25 ¬µL of reagent. The total well volume should not exceed 65 ¬µL ‚Äì otherwise there is a risk of overflow. üòµ
        :::

    -   Adding CTG reagent with a liquid dispenser is helpful here (like with dispensing cells)

-   Centrifuge plates for \~4 minutes, \~1100 RPM

-   Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes

-   Read viability on luminometer

### Collecting data

-   Collect the raw luminescent data and save it as a .CSV file.

-   This file should contain only 384-well format (16 rows by 24 columns) data, and **nothing else.** For example:

</iframe>

-   It is recommended to make a copy of your raw data and save a version containing only the required information, which will be used during the analysis.
